#### Detecting putatively adaptive differentiation

We used several methods for detected putatively adaptive differentiation.

The first is Fst outlier detection methods, for which we used [*BayeScan*](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/BayeScan/) and [*OutFLANK*](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/305384_9aee1c1046394fb9bd8e449453d72847.html). I ran BayesScan in the GUI using default parameters and plotted the output using [this script](https://github.com/nclowell/SeaCukes/blob/master/4_detecting_adaptive_differentiation/plot_bayescan.R). I ran OutFLANK and plotted the results using [this script](https://github.com/nclowell/SeaCukes/blob/master/4_detecting_adaptive_differentiation/OutFLANK.R).

The second is gene environment association methods, for which we used [*bayenv2*](https://gcbias.org/bayenv/) and redundancy analysis. For both, I gathered environmental predictor data from the Bio-Oracle and Bio-Oracle2 databases using [this script](https://github.com/nclowell/SeaCukes/blob/master/4_detecting_adaptive_differentiation/access_biooracle_for_env_predictors.R). Environmental data was not available for one site (Eld Inlet, WA) so it was excluded from further gene-environment association analyses. 

Then, for bayenv2, I ran it using scaled environmental data, using default parameters (-k 100000) and the supplied script for running *bayenv2* per locus. Results were parsed using [this notebook](https://github.com/nclowell/SeaCukes/blob/master/4_detecting_adaptive_differentiation/parsing_bayenv2_results.ipynb).

For redundancy analysis, I used the R package [*vegan*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html) and [this script](https://github.com/nclowell/SeaCukes/blob/master/4_detecting_adaptive_differentiation/RDA.R). I ran regular RDAs and partial RDAs that conditioned spatial MEM variables, to account of neutral variation attributed to isolation-by-distance. I did so using multiple sets of predictors. For each set of predictors, I reduced them to few PCs. The sets of predictors were all variables, sea surface variables, bottom depth variables, and variables related to current velocity and temperature.
