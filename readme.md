## Sea Cucumber Population Structure Project

#### Project description
A research team led by Dan Cheney of the Pacific Shellfish Institute is developing methods to co-culture the giant California sea cucumber, *Parastichopus californicus*, underneath currently farmed species like salmonids, sable fish, and oysters. One part of this study is to investigate whether spatially distinct populations of the species exist, as to inform out-planting strategies. To answer this question, I am investigating whether there is population structure in *Parastichopus californicus* using RAD sequencing. I am developing molecular markers and genotyping individuals from at least 7 populations, from Alaska to California on the west cost of North America.

This research is funded by NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy program grant number 2004246.
