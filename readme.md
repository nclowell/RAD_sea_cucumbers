#### Project description
A research team led by Dan Cheney of the Pacific Shellfish Institute is developing methods to co-culture the giant California sea cucumber, *Parastichopus californicus*, underneath currently farmed species like salmonids, sable fish, and oysters. One part of this study is to investigate whether spatially distinct populations of the species exist, as to inform out-planting strategies. To answer this question, I am investigating whether there is population structure in *Parastichopus californicus* using RAD sequencing. I am developing molecular markers and genotyping individuals from at least 7 populations, from Alaska to California on the west cost of North America.

This research is funded by NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy program grant number 2004246. A one-page project description can be found [here](http://www.pacshell.org/pdf/SK%20Sea%20Cuc.pdf).

#### Overview of methods

The research team collected tissue samples from seven populations, ranging from Alaska to California. I extracted, quantified and verified quality of DNA, and then prepared RAD libraries follwing to [Etter et al 2011](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-61779-228-1_9). I clustered loci and genotyped individuals using the [ipyrad](http://ipyrad.readthedocs.io/ethos.html) pipeline, and calculated population genetic statistics using ``hierfstat``.
